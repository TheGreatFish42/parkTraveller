My simple web app for finding state parks and monuments.

Simply just filter through the list of states and select the one that you would like to visit.
A list of all the state parks should appear courtesy of the National Park Services API.
If you have any issues I have provided my contact information at the bottom of each page, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Future Features:
Sign-in allowing users to add parks to their favorites list
List of all your favorite parks for you to view later
Guest Browsing, allowing users to look at parks without requiring a sign in
